# Challenge
### Doubly Linked lists

A doubly linked list is a data structure consisting of nodes, where each node contains data, a reference to the next node in the sequence, and a reference to the previous node.

**Example:**
```
      head
       |
       v
+------+------+     +------+------+     +------+------+
| prev | data |     | prev | data |     | prev | data |
|  -   |  10  |     |  10  |  20  |     |  20  |  30  |
| next |      |<--->| next |      |<--->| next |      |
|  20  |      |     |  30  |      |     |  -   |      |
+------+------+     +------+------+     +------+------+
                                               ^
                                               |
                                              tail
```

Your task is to implement a doubly linked list, with the following operations:
- Insert head and tail
- Remove an element
- Remove repeated elements
- Search for an element
- Size of the list

Make sure to include an example testing your implementation.
